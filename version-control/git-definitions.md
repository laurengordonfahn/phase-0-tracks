# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? 
	- Software that allows you to save different versions of code and go back to previously saved versions 
* Why is it useful?
	- If you want you have a bug at one layer you can go back, if you deltete something all is not lost, if you want to see how a different code would impact the system you can have multiple copies of code with slight veriation!
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	-Branches are copies of code that you can alter without losing or altering the orginal root code, multiple people can be working on identiacal but different branches at once, it allows saftey and multitasking.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	- A commit is when you take a file ready for saving in the Repository and add a message to it lableing what conntent it has that is different from previous versions and then save it to the Repository so you have that version to manipulate or come back to later. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	- Can happen in a number of instances. Such as when merging a branch into a current working branch and the same file in each branch has been altered differently. You then need to step in and tell git what to do so a conflict isn't a bad thing as much as telling you hey I don't know how you want this to look help me out! Sometime we need to make choices in life, this is one of those times!
		So understand what the conflict is, and then make some choices of how you want the merged branch to end up looking and clean up the conflict by choosing which code will stay.
