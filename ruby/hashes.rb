#this is the out line of our hash key's 
#client_name = {:name :age :number_children :decor_theme :likes_grey :like_brown :budget :street_address}

#ask the user for all the values for each key term in the hash

#convert the user input to the appropriate data type ie .to_s .to_i .to_a if needed

#print the hash with key and values present for user to street_address

#propmpt the user to update any keys one time, "none" will skip this step but if a key is called the program should allow for update, note: use stringmethod to convert a string to a symbol

#print the latest version of the hash and exit program
