	- use Translator (below) for letters
	- any other response should enter
		If you have any other letters then see bottom of instructions for how to figure out what to do!

Translator for lettered floors:
L= = Lobby  Should be interpreted 0
B= = Basement Should be interpreted -1
B(number)= A floor below ground and should be interpreted (- (absolute value of the number))
If transloator used then present_floor = translator_answer_present_floor

puts ( "Do you know what floor you want to go to, Robot?")
desired_floor_known= gets.chomp

	- Answers can be "yes" or "no"
