	<p> ## A section usally has a heading and groups content
		 Article is self-contained information
		 footer is adjunctive information to the main information 
		 nav extra query
		 aside is related to the main containt often but not part of it

		 These elements make it easier for seraching for proper webpages as each element has different priority: like the main shares a summary should have key search words as should the heading of the section, these are like handles that the search engine can grab on to each with different priority and accesibility.

		 I love snippets and hope to snippet reguarly
		 I would like to learn more about how to make snippets not just in a folder but across sublime- and I will have to look this up I found it hard to do the form I don't understand how the form pattern works very well and I also don't understand how to make soemthing post instantly to the webpage after submitting, where does the information go?##
